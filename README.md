Hack created at HackUCI 2014 with Jeffrey Chien

Youtube demo video - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw63P6ecRxc

How we made it:

Oculus Rift Programming - done in Unity3d, a scripted drag'n'drop interface that let us create the terrain and obstacles.

Wiimote Programming - done with UniWii (http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title=UniWii), a plugin/interface that lets you use the Wiimote as an input device in Unity. Used for steering/tilt detection in the longboard.

Project was completed in ~16 hours, then demo-ed on the next day, as shown in the video.

We ended up placing Top 10 at HackUCI.

Thanks for reading!

Note: Game currently can only be run in Unity, the build version does not support Wiimote interaction. We are working on that.
